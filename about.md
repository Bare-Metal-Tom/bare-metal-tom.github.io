Hello! I have been enamored with computers ever since I took my first Python programming class at Cape Fear Community College. 
Now, with over three years of experience in the IT field, I approach every challenge—whether it's a networking conundrum, 
an automation script, or a client seeking guidance—with enthusiasm, curiosity, and critical thinking.

### My Goal For This Site

I wanted a place to document, organize, and showcase the various projects I've worked on, and I figured GitHub Pages
would be the perfect platform for that. These blog posts are meant to be helpful to you and also serve as a way for me to 
reinforce the skills I've learned.
